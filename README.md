# Azalea
Toy language written in Rust that compiles to Javascript.

## Design Decisions
1. Everything is an expression
2. Records map almost 1:1 to Javascript objects

## Open source?
Azalea is currently not open source, however it will be released under a permissive
FOSS license when the barebones compiler has been implemented.
