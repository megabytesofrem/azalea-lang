# Azalea
Toy language written in Rust that compiles to Javascript.

## Design Decisions
1. Everything is an expression
2. Records map almost 1:1 to Javascript objects

## Rationale
I wanted a language that I can personally use for a lot of small projects, so targeting
Javascript was a necessity.

The syntax is a mix of Rust, Scala, and Lua.
